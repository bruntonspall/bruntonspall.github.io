One of the requested articles on this site was a comprehensive diary of what went into building this website, and why I did so.&nbsp; Since for shits and giggles wasn&#39;t exactly the answer you wanted, I thought I&#39;d elucidate on why I built this and how I went about it.

<!--more-->

Essentially this site is here to serve my vanity, to give me a project I can work on with some cool technologies, and to enable me an outlet for some of the articles and opinions that i&#39;ve built up over time.

I used to have a <a href="http://www.mibgames.co.uk">mibgames</a> blog but since I&#39;m no longer gainfully working on my own indepentent games I&#39;ve decided to gracefully retire it.&nbsp; I&#39;ve also started to shift away from an online presence based around the mibgames persona and instead concentrate on the <a href="http://twitter.com/bruntonspall">bruntonspall</a> name.&nbsp; This is because I&#39;ve been talking at more conferences around web 2.0 and web development, and I&#39;m often asked why I have the twitter name mibgames.&nbsp; A better &quot;brand&quot; for me is the bruntonspall name, since it&#39;s more personally identifiable, and in a way slightly more professional.

So anyway, whats the story behind this website, and the planned features?&nbsp; Well I covered a bit about the story behind the website in my first post, but here&#39;s a bit more back information.

I work at <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> as a web developer.&nbsp; Part of that work involves working on new web functionality, and often involves using new technologies and so forth.&nbsp; But the guardian website is not the sort of site you can just play around with.&nbsp; Adding something like facebook connect, or openid is not the sort of technology one can decide on a whim to play with.&nbsp; So the need to have somewhere to play came up, and I tried making a few toy projects, but my heart was never in it, I knew this wasn&#39;t a real project, and so I couldn&#39;t really be bothered.

So with the upcoming 30th birthday, the need for a real project, and the decision to start shifting my online presence I decided I needed a new brunton-spall website.&nbsp; The old one was shockingly bad after all!&nbsp; This gave me the necessary impetus to decide to try out some new web technologies and try some stuff i&#39;ve never done before.

Because of it&#39;s existence as a test bed for technologies this site is unlikely to be entirely stable at all times.&nbsp; It was never meant to be, and things might shift around, features might get added or removed.&nbsp; I&#39;m going to try my best to not lose any data, and to obey the rules of the web, so addressed content should stay there if at all possible, but we&#39;ll see how this goes.&nbsp; As the website gets bigger and more popular I&#39;ll think about moving it onto a more permanant host, and creating a beta site, that has mirror content but with less stable technologies.

So how about the future?&nbsp; Well I&#39;m gonna keep some of that under my hat still, mostly because it&#39;s not all laid out or planned very well just yet.&nbsp; You can be sure however that my first thing to develop is some method of bi-directional communication.&nbsp; This website isn&#39;t just for me to put even more stuff into the world, but a way for you people to comment back.&nbsp; I&#39;m undecided right now whether to add the comment system via Disqus, or Facebook Connect.&nbsp; If you hae an opinion, then twitter me at @bruntonspall
