<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform/blog/scale-camp-2010">This article titled "Announcing Scale Camp 2010" was written by Michael Brunton-Spall, for guardian.co.uk on Wednesday 22nd September 2010 13.47 UTC</a>

It was about this time last year that I <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform/blog/uk-scale-camp">first started thinking</a> about <a href="http://www.scalecamp.org.uk">Scale Camp</a>. If you are into scalability and performance then there aren't many places to go to learn more or meet with your peers.  The main place to go is the<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2010"> Velocity conference</a> in the US, but for a lot of companies and people over here in Europe, that's a pretty expensive option.  We decided to organise our own unconference all about scalability and host it here in London.

Hopefully you know the story; the unconference was a blast, some of the smartest people I've ever met came and talked, they all shared about what they were doing and I was left speechless that so many people would want to join in.

When we asked people after whether we should do it again, the comments were best summed up by this one: "Please god yes", so we've been actively thinking about it again this year and trying to organise space and time itself to get the details just right.  We are very pleased to be able to announce:

<strong>Scale Camp 2010 will be on the 10th December at the Guardian Offices here in London</strong>.

We're very excited that the buzz that Scale Camp generated last year means that it will be really hard to beat this year, but we are going to try our hardest to make it even better.

As there's a limited amount of physical space, the conference will, like last year, be invite only.  You can <a href="http://www.scalecamp.org.uk/request-an-invitation">request an invite</a> over at the Scale Camp site.  The guardian will be there, and if last years company list is anything to go by we'll be hoping to see the cream of web scale developers from the UK and beyond coming to share in the excitement.

There is strictly limited space and we'll be sending out the invites in waves, so get in early and request an invite as soon as possible from the Scale Camp website.  If you are coming we'd love for you to update <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2010/scalecamp/">Lanyrd</a> as well to spread some buzz about Scale Camp.

We really hope to see you at the camp.
