So as 2009 draws to a close, I look back over the year and consider what has happened. &nbsp;With this being the end of the decade for everyone but pedants (that will be another year yet), I&#39;ve also thought about the previous decade.

10 years ago I was halfway through my degree, determined that I would become a famous game designer, or at least be designing with a &nbsp;major games studio. &nbsp;I was still determined not to become a programmer, and instead wanted to spend my days fiddling with excel, scripting langauges and writing design documents and so forth. &nbsp;Fast forward 10 years and I&#39;m now working as a programmer in the web industry, speaking at conferences and even organising conferences like scale camp!

This year has been real fun, I&#39;ve really settled into my role at the Guardian newspaper, and the coming year will hopefully see me extending that role into more developer evangalism focused areas. &nbsp;I was pleased to recently read a list of a number of technologies that one &quot;must have used&quot; in 2009, including a NoSQL datastore, a dynamic language framework and a non-blocking long poll framework such as node.js. &nbsp;I&#39;ve had the opportunity this year to spend time using Reddis, Django, Python and even a brief play with node.js and the tornado framework.

How about resolutions for 2010? &nbsp;Well I&#39;d like to increase the quantity and quality of my blogging. &nbsp;That will hopefully mean writing more often, as I&#39;m repeatedly told that the best way to improve ones writing abiity is to practice it as often as possible. &nbsp;I wont promise any particular update schedule, as I&#39;ve tried that before, but rest assured like all new years resolutions, january will be more active before I get bored and forget to do any more!

I also wish to try my hand at some more new technologies, trying to keep up with the changes in the industry and the way in which programming is changing. &nbsp;The main aims for the early year is going to be trying to have a play with Yahoo Application Framework and the Facebook platform, and trying out some more social tools to explore the concepts and patterns involved.

I hope you have had a great 2009, and have a good new year and an enjoyable 2010.
